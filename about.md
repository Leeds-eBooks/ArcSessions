Arc Sessions is a new site for live poetry.

At [Arc Publications](http://arcpublications.co.uk/), we believe it is essential to hear a poet read their work. The printed page or screen can only tell you so much; with the author's voice, expression, movement and intonation, you get access to their motivation, the emotion behind a poem, its human provenance.

As we find and make new films of our international poets, we will add them to this list. It will be a dynamic, ever-growing archive of some of the world&rsquo;s best poetry.

Please enjoy and if you like it, spread the word.

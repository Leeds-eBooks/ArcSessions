Are you having problems viewing this site? Please note the following:

- This site has been built to work on the latest browsers (down to and including Internet Explorer 9). It may very well work on older browsers, but we are a small publishing team producing all our digital platforms in-house, so unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to test on *every* possible system. [Check your browser version](https://whatbrowser.org/).
- This site relies on [JavaScript](http://enable-javascript.com/). You will need Javascript [enabled](http://enable-javascript.com/) to access any of the Arc Sessions content.
- If you find that something isn&rsquo;t working, please do contact us at [ben@arcpublications.co.uk](mailto:ben@arcpublications.co.uk?subject=Arc%20Sessions%20bug), stating your operating system, browser version, and what the problem is.

This is an open source project: you can find all the source code for Arc Sessions [over on GitHub](https://github.com/Leeds-eBooks/ArcSessions).
